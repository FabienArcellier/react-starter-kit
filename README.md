# React Quick Start Guide

This is the boilerplate code for following along with the React quick start guide. It contains an index.html with React JS and the JSX transpiler. It's not intended for production purposes, just for quickly getting setup in order to learn React JS. It also contains a small amount of CSS.

All code from the guide should go in the script.js file found in the root of this repo.

## Setup Guide

`git clone git@github.com:jarsbe/react-quick-guide-boilerplate react-quick-guide`

`cd react-quick-guide`

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
